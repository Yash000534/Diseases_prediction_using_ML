# Diseases_prediction_using_ML
# Diseases Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts diseases based on various input features. It leverages historical data to train models that can assist in early diagnosis or risk assessment of diseases.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Multiple ML algorithms implemented (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- User-friendly interface for input and prediction (if applicable)
- Visualization of results and insights

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
- Git for version control

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash000534/Diseases_prediction_using_ML.git
cd Diseases_prediction_using_ML
